# GasPrice App

This free app will allow users to find nearby gas stations and see their gas prices so they can find the
cheapest gas price without driving to the actual gas station first.

The app will ask for your current locations (by location services or zip code), then show you a list view of gas stations in the area. Prices will be shown to the left of the gas station name and logo.
